# jquery-drawer
Drawer is a simple jQuery plugin for adding a sliding drawer functionality to any HTML element. It can be used to show/hide any element with sliding effect of a drawer. The Drawer can be anchored to any side of the page or a div. It can also be configured to stick to any of the page edges (top, right, bottom or left) to get a floating effect.
